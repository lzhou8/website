    <h1>Flight Delays: An Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
    <h4><u>Introduction:</u></h4>
    <p>From May to August 2019, I interned at a major U.S. airline, and as a result, I had the opportunity of exploring the world through standby travel.</p>
    <p>
        This summer, Iâ€™ve been to:
        <ul>
          <li>Munich, Germany</li>
          <li>Barcelona, Spain</li>
          <li>Lucerne, Switzerland</li>
          <li>Zurich, Switzerland</li>
          <li>Amsterdam, Netherlands</li>
          <li>Lake Como, Italy</li>
          <li>San Francisco, CA</li>
          <li>NYC, New York</li>
        </ul>
        Being a frequent flyer this summer, I was inspired to create some data visualizations to gain key insights about airline travel.
    </p>

    <h4><u>Problem Statement:</u></h4>
    <p>As a standby traveller, I've experienced flight delays ranging from <= 1 hour to a couple hours. My longest delay was 5 hours at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on the way back to Atlanta. This got me curious in the statistics behind flight delays.
    <br>
    <br>
      Hence, this project was created to analyze why and how frequently flight delays occur for passengers on 4 major U.S. airlines (Delta, United, Southwest, and American) in a given year. 
    </p>

    <h4><u>Analysis:</u></h4>

    <p><i>Which of the 4 airlines had the most flight delays in 2018?</i>
      <br>
      <i>What were the most common reasons for flight delays in 2018?</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      To answer these questions, I decided to create some data visualizations exploring different aspects of 12 datasets provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
      <br>
      This 1st data visualization depicts the # of flight delays for every month in the year of 2018 across 4 airlines:
    </p>

    <div id="vis1">
      <script src="js/main.js"></script>
    </div>

  <p>
    What is interesting to observe here is that Southwest Airlines had the highest number of flight delays in every month of 2018. In July 2018, Southwest reached its peak of 1,913,938 flight delays - the highest reported number out of 4 airlines.
    The data seems to suggest a general increase in flight delays during the early summer months for all 4 airlines, until a "peak" or "maximum" is reached. After that, there is a drastic decline in flight delays. For instance, Southwest's maximum is 1913938 in August; American's maximum is 1526681 in July; Delta's maximum is 1285146 in June; and United's maximum is 1229876 in August.
      <br>
      <br>
      What could be causing these flight delays?
      The 12 datasets that I've used report 5 different reasons for flight delays: carrier, weather, NAS (National Air System), security, or late aircraft. I found this <a href="https://aspmhelp.faa.gov/index.php/Types_of_Delay">link</a> to be helpful in understanding their definitions.
      <br>
      <br>
      To analyze the reasons behind flight delays, I created the following data visualization:
  </p>

  <div id="vis2">
    <script src="js/chart.js"></script>
  </div> 

  <br>
  <p> Interestingly, weather is the #1 reason behind flight delays for all 4 airlines. This makes sense, as tornadoes, hurricanes, and thunderstorms could all prevent an airplane from taking off at the scheduled time. The second most frequent reason would be carrier delays, which include cleaning/maintenance of the aircraft and cargo loading.
    <br>
  <br>
  The third and fourth reasons are delays incurred by NAS (National Air System) and late aircraft arrivals. NAS is responsible for maintaining optimal air traffic conditions, and a flight would be delayed if there is heavy traffic or other blockages. Late aircraft arrival delays are caused by the late arrival of the preceding aircraft, thus causing a propagation effect for the next aircraft to depart late and arrive late.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security delays represent the least amount for Delta, American, United, and Southwest. Since these delays result from intruder breaches or terminal evacuations, which are rare occurrences, it may be an unsurprising fact that they account for a much smaller percentage of total flight delays in 2018.

  <br>
  <h4><u>Technical Challenges:</u></h4>
  <p> Throughout this project, I learned how to create data visualizations with d3.js, HTML, and CSS. 
  <br>
  <br>
  To read a CSV file, d3.js offers a built-in function: d3.csv(). However, this function is asychronous, 
  which may not be ideal when working with numerous CSV files. After some research, I decided to use the d3-queue library (which loads CSV files concurrently) and found this <a href="https://macwright.org/2016/12/09/a-d3-queue-mental-model.html">link</a> to be especially helpful. </p>
