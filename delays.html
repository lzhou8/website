        <p class="lead" style="color: black;">Airlines routinely experience up to thousands of flight delays every day. This exploratory data analysis therefore seeks to investigate flight delays in the year of 2018 across 4 major airlines. </p>

    <h2 align="left">Data Collection</h2>

    <p>
      I used d3.js to read 12 datasets (in CSV format) provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Each dataset contains millions of flight delay records for over 15+ airlines in a certain calendar month. Within each dataset, each record contains statistics such as origin airport, destination airport, number of delay minutes, and more.<br><br>

      Since I wanted to retrieve relevant statistics for 4 specific airlines (Delta, American, United, and Southwest), I decided to first preprocess the data by using d3â€™s built-in CSV function to read in and reformat data from multiple CSV files.

      Once preprocessed, the data was then used to build 2 different visualizations: 1) an interactive line chart to visualize the overall trends in flight delays and 2) a bar chart to visualize 5 different causes of flight delays.

    <h2 align="left">Visualizations</h2>

    <p>
      This first data visualization is an interactive line chart that portrays the overall trends in flight delays across 12 months for each of the 4 airlines.

    <p>This second data visualization seeks to address the common causes of flight delays between the 4 major airlines. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 5 different causes of flight delays are generally reported: carrier, weather, NAS (National Air System), security, or late aircraft.</p>
    <div id="vis2"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 align="left">Analysis</h2>
    <p>From the first visualization, an interesting observation is that Southwest Airlines had the highest number of flight delays across the board. In July 2018, Southwest reached its peak of 1,913,938 flight delays: the highest reported number within the year. United Airlines, on the other hand, seems to have experienced much lower flight delays compared to the other airlines. 
    The data additionally suggests that the number of flight delays increases during the summer months and levels off during the fall and winter months. This phenomenon could be explained by an increase in travel in the summer.
    <br><br>
    The second visualization gives us several insights about the reasons behind flight delays. Perhaps unsuprisingly, weather is the #1 reason behind flight delays for all 4 airlines. Carrier delays make up the #2 reason, which include cleaning/maintenance of the aircraft and cargo loading. The third and fourth reasons are delays incurred by NAS (National Air System) and late aircraft arrivals. NAS is responsible for maintaining optimal air traffic conditions. Therefore, a flight might be delayed due to heavy air traffic. Late aircraft arrival delays are caused by the late arrival of the preceding aircraft, causing a propagation effect for the next aircraft to depart late. Lastly, security delays represent the most infrequent reason behind flight delays, which are caused by intruder breaches or terminal evacuations.</p>
