    <h1>Flight Delays: An Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
    <h4><u>Introduction:</u></h4>
    <p>From May to August 2019, I interned at a U.S. airline and had the opportunity of exploring the world through standby travel. 
    Being a frequent flyer this summer, I've experienced flight delays ranging from less than an hour to a couple hours. This inspired me to create some data visualizations to gain key insights behind flight delays.
    </p>

    <h4><u>Data:</u></h4>
    <p>I used d3.js to read 12 datasets (in CSV format) provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Each dataset contains millions of flight delay records for over 15+ airlines in a certain calendar month. Within each dataset, each record contains statistics such as origin airport, destination airport, number of delay minutes, and more.

    <br>
    <br>Since I wanted to extract relevant statistics for 4 specific airlines (Delta, American, United, and Southwest), I decided to first preprocess the data by using d3â€™s built-in CSV and queue functions to read in and reformat data from multiple CSV files.

  Once preprocessed, the data was then used to build 2 different visualizations: 1) an interactive line chart in d3.js to visualize the overall trends in flight delays in 2018 for 4 airlines, and 2) a bar chart to visualize 5 different causes of flight delays.
  </p>


    <h4><u>Analysis:</u></h4>

    <p>This first visualization seeks to answer the following questions:
    <p>
      <i>Which of the 4 airlines had the most flight delays in 2018?</i><br>
      <i>What are some observable trends in flight delays in 2018?</i>
    </p>

    <div id="vis1">
      <script src="js/main.js"></script>
    </div>

  <p>
    An interesting observation here is that Southwest Airlines had the highest number of flight delays across the board. In July 2018, Southwest reached its peak of 1,913,938 flight delays - the highest reported number within the year.
    Additionally, the data seems to suggest a general increase in flight delays during the summer months for all 4 airlines. This phenomenon could be explained by an increase in travel in the summer. 
    <br><br>
    The second visualization seeks to answer the following question:
      <i>What were the causes of flight delays in 2018?</i><br>
      <br>According to the 12 datasets, 5 different causes of flight delays have been reported: carrier, weather, NAS (National Air System), security, or late aircraft. I found this <a href="https://aspmhelp.faa.gov/index.php/Types_of_Delay">link</a> to be helpful in understanding their definitions.
  </p>

    <script src="js/chart.js"></script>
  </div> 

  <br>
  <p> Interestingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, weather is the #1 reason behind flight delays for all 4 airlines. Carrier delays make up the #2 reason, which include cleaning/maintenance of the aircraft and cargo loading.
    <br>
  <br>
  The third and fourth reasons are delays incurred by NAS (National Air System) and late aircraft arrivals. NAS is responsible for maintaining optimal air traffic conditions; thus a flight would be delayed if there is heavy air traffic. Late aircraft arrival delays are caused by the late arrival of the preceding aircraft, causing a propagation effect for the next aircraft to depart late.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security delays represent the most infrequent reason behind flight delays across all 4 airlines. These delays result from intruder breaches or terminal evacuations, which are rare occurrences.
